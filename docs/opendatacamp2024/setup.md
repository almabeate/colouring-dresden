# How to set up a local dev environment of the Colouring Dresden platform

## At the beginning

- Install Oracle Virtual Box and create a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Download database dump from IOER server (**ask team of Colouring Dresden for URL and access, E-Mail is required to grant access**)
  - the DB Dump contains all data from Colouring Dresden (22.05.2024), user data were replaced by dummy data to be data-compliant
- **Only use GitHub branch "opendatacamp2024" (or new branches) for coding!**
