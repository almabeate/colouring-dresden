# Open Data Camp 2024 in Dresden

A warm welcome to the Open Data Camp 2024 in Dresden and to the Colouring Dresden project!

## Challenge

Colouring Dresden is part of the challenge "" and offers the opportunity to use a dataset containing crowd-sourced

## About Colouring Dresden

- Goal is to collect attributes for each building, like age, number of storeys, material
- collecting a more precise dataset to describe buildings and to fill current gaps in existing datasets
- make spatial modeling easier e.g. for AI prediction algorithm, for research or planning in the fields of climate adaption (flooding, heavy rain indicents, heat) or climate change (energy, reduction of CO2, ...)
- everybody can contribute 
- part of international research network Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP)

### Data categories
- All building attributes are assigned to one category (so-called "tiles")
- currently, seven are in use. Further will be enabled in future
- documentation see:
