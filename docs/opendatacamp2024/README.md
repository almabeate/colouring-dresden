# Open Data Camp 2024 in Dresden

A warm welcome to the Open Data Camp 2024 in Dresden and to the Colouring Dresden project!

The project is organised in Dresden by **Leibniz-Institute of Ecological Urband Regional Development (IOER)** in Dresden (https://www.ioer.de/projekte/colouring-dresden)

## Challenge

Colouring Dresden is part of the challenge "Digitaler Energiezwilling f√ºr Dresden" and offers the opportunity:
- to use a dataset containing crowd-sourced collected building attributes 
- to code new features within the Colouring Dresden platform


see website of the ODC: https://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort/projekte-kooperationen/open-data-camp-2024.php


## About Colouring Dresden

- Goal is to collect attributes for each building, like age, number of storeys, material
- collecting a more precise dataset to describe buildings and to fill current gaps in existing datasets
- make spatial modeling easier e.g. for AI prediction algorithm, for research or planning in the fields of climate adaption (flooding, heavy rain indicents, heat) or climate change (energy, reduction of CO2, ...)
- everybody can contribute 
- part of international research network Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP)

### Data categories
- All building attributes (about 40) are assigned to a thematic category (so-called "tiles")
- currently, seven are in use. Further will be enabled in future
